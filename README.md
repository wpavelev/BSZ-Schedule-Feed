Berufliches Schulzentrum f√ºr Elektrotechnik Dresden offers online access to the substitution timetable. This is available as a PDF file and there is no notification of changes.

This Azure function checks every 5 minutes whether there is a new timetable for the IT classes. As soon as an update is available, it sends a message to a Telegram channel.
